**DayChunks** is a privacy-focused, standalone web application designed for high-focus "Deep Work." It allows you to slice your day into meaningful, color-coded time chunks using an interactive visual timeline.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Privacy by Design:** All data is stored locally in your browser's storage. Your schedule never leaves your device.
- **Offline-Ready:** Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) – it works perfectly without an internet connection.
- **Visual Timeline:** A "buttery-smooth" interactive axis for a bird's-eye view of your daily flow.
- **Audio Cues:** Stay in the zone with customizable audio alarms for each time-chunk.
- **Desktop Optimized:** Specifically designed for workstation-class focus and large screens.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** C# / .NET 8 Blazor WebAssembly (WASM).
- **Architecture:** Standalone Client-side Application.
- **Storage:** Browser Local Storage (Zero server-side database).
- **Deployment:** Static Web Hosting.

## 💡 Why DayChunks?

In an era of cloud-first tools that harvest user data, **DayChunks** offers a "tools-for-thought" approach:
1. **Zero tracking:** No analytics (unless explicitly consented), no cookies.
2. **Focus-first:** No notifications, no social features, just you and your time.
3. **Speed:** Lightweight Blazor implementation for near-instant load times.

## 📖 How to Use

1. Visit [daychunks.com](https://daychunks.com).
2. Create your first "chunk" by defining a time slot.
3. Assign a color and (optional) an audio alarm.
4. Keep the tab open on your second monitor to stay on track throughout the day.
